# Lessons Learned – SenseBox Mini

## Early Development Phase

- Learned how to structure an embedded project repository in a clean and scalable way.
- Understood the importance of separating firmware, hardware schematics, CAD files, and documentation.
- Learned how to use WakaTime for automatic coding time tracking and how to complement it with manual time logging.
- Gained experience with ESP32-C3 pin mapping and constraints.
- Learned how capacitive touch inputs work on ESP32 and how they differ from mechanical buttons.
- Implemented basic alert logic using thresholds and a single buzzer notification to avoid alert spamming.
- Learned why prototyping with mock sensor values is useful before integrating real hardware sensors.
